# Chatty Kleenex Group Project

## Technologies Used:

    * HTML5 
    * CSS 
    * JavaScript 
    * Bootstrap 4 
    * ES6 Modules 


## Description 

Our group created a chat application. The project features a navigation bar, which has an input area and two buttons. One button is to clear the messages and the other button offers three different background theme choices. 

Below the navigation bar we have options to change the messages background color theme, text color and text size. Additionally, you can choose a username to display before your messages throughout your conversation.

The chat application deletes the top message after 20 messages have been reached. Lastly, as the bonus, the user receives an alert when the type a "bad word".
